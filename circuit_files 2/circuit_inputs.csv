Name of the circuit file, Change the file name to the name of the circuit file. The file has to be .csv file so do not use another extension.,three_ph_load.csv,inv1_volt.csv,inv1_filt.csv,inv4_volt.csv,inv4_filt.csv,comp_connectors.csv,comp_inv2.csv,inv2_filter.csv,comp_inv3.csv,inv3_filter.csv,
Time duration of simulation, This is the time in seconds.,3,,,,,,,,,,
Time step of the simulation, Recommened to be less than 10 microseconds for accuracy.,0.000001,,,,,,,,,,
Time step of data storage, This is the time step with data is stored and has to be equal to or greater than the simulation time step.,0.00001,,,,,,,,,,
Name of the data storage file, This is where all meter data and control signals will be stored., ckt_output4.dat,,,,,,,,,,
Name of control files, Add or remove as many control files as needed in separate columns.,pll.py,inv1_voltcon.py,inv1_modulator.py,inv4_voltcon.py,inv4_modulator.py,comp_inv2_reference.py,currcon_inv2.py,inv2_modulator.py,comp_inv3_reference.py,currcon_inv3.py,inv3_modulator.py
Split the output file?, Say yes if you think the data file is too large and plotting is taking too much time or else say no.,yes,,,,,,,,,,
Length of time windows, There should be at least two intervals for storage.,0.5,,,,,,,,,,
